# Gradient Descent Algorithm for Linear Regression
This README provides an overview of the Python code that implements the gradient descent algorithm for linear regression. The purpose of this code is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the cost function and predicts a linear relationship between two variables.

## Code Overview
The code implements the following steps:

## Data Preparation
The code starts by importing the necessary numpy library and creating two arrays, x and y, representing the input features and the corresponding target values. These arrays represent a simple linear relationship.

## Gradient Descent Function
The core of the code is the gradient_descent() function, which takes the input arrays x and y. It initializes the slope (m_curr) and intercept (b_curr) of the line to zero and specifies the number of iterations, learning rate, and the number of data points (n).

## Iterative Update
The function performs an iterative update over the specified number of iterations. In each iteration, it calculates the predicted values y_predict using the current slope and intercept. Then, it computes the cost function using the mean squared error formula. The gradients of the cost function with respect to the slope and intercept (md and bd, respectively) are calculated.

## Gradient Descent Step
The slope and intercept are then updated using the gradient descent update rule:
```
parameter = parameter - learning_rate * gradient.

```
 This step adjusts the parameters in the direction of the steepest descent in order to minimize the cost.

## Printing Progress
The code prints the updated values of the slope, intercept, cost, and iteration number for each iteration. As the iterations progress, the slope and intercept should converge to optimal values that minimize the cost.

## Data and Execution
Finally, the code defines sample data arrays x and y and calls the gradient_descent() function with these data arrays.

## Conclusion
This README provides an explanation of how the gradient descent algorithm is used for linear regression. The code demonstrates how the algorithm iteratively adjusts the slope and intercept of the line to find the best-fitting model that minimizes the cost function. Users can further experiment with different learning rates, initialization values, and number of iterations to observe how these factors affect the convergence of the algorithm and the accuracy of the model's predictions.
